        <p style="border: 2px solid green; ">Hello! My name is <b>John Sarcione</b> and I am a student at <u>New England Tech </u> studying <i>Cybersecurity and Network Engineering</i>. I am from Attleboro Massachusetts and work at Helix Esports at Patriot Place. It is a video game center under OXG Esports. We have a pro CoD team called the <b>Boston Breach</b> and a pro OWL team called <b>Boston Uprising.</b> As someone who enjoys playing video games and competitive CoD, this job is perfect for me. I also enjoy listening to live music and playing with my dog Mando.</p>
