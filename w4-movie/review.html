            <h2><b>Review</b> of<em> Interstellar</em></h2>
            <p><b>JR Sarcione</b> <i>August 10, 2023</i></p>
            <p><em>Interstellar</em> takes you on a visually stunning journey through space and time. Director Christopher Nolan takes you on this intellectual journey that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The film takes place on a starving, over populated and dying earth where Cooper (played by Matthew McConaughey) must leave his family to save humanity. His journey develops some complex themes such as time dilation, human connection, and vastness of the universe. Not only the is the story that Christopher Nolan tells is jaw dropping, but also scientifically plausible.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Lead Actor Matthew McConaughey plays the main role of Cooper extremely well. You really feel every emotion with Cooper from being lost in space and seeing his family from the outside, to the joy at the end of the movie when he reunites with his daughter after being decades apart. My only gripe with this movie is that some of the secondary characters do not get enough screen time or background as they either feel somewhat forgettable or leaves wanting to see the character more. Another criticism is that you need to be a hundred percent invested into movie. This movie is not a film you put on the background. The viewer has to be invested or the viewer will lose the plot. Overall this is my favorite movie and one of the greatest movies to ever be filmed.</p>
